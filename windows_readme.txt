Windows users will need to install the following packages:

	- GTK+
	http://gtk-win.sourceforge.net/home/index.php/en/Downloads

	- Python 2.6
	http://www.python.org

	- PyGOject, PyGTK, PyCairo for Python 2.6
	http://www.pygtk.org/downloads.html

Note: Until first stable version is released support for systems
other than Linux is not really good. You are most likely to run
into problems. If you need help, feel free to contact me.
